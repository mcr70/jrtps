o Project name
	- bluepepper? bluespepper?
o QoS
	- missing EntityFactoryQos, ReaderDataLifeCycle, WriterDataLifecycle
o Domain ID & participant ID
	- Domain ID is encoded in GuidPrefix	
o types
	- octet -> byte
	- long -> int
o SequenceNumber_t -> java long	
o Should we utilize DDS types like DDS.Duration_t
o Optional RTPS stuff, 8.4.14
	- DataFrag, HeartbeatFrag, NackFrag
o each submessage is aligned on 32 bit boundary
o writeTo needs to be reconsidered. Maybe BytesBuffer will help
  SubMessageHeader needs to write submessage length into stream.
  It is not necessary easy to calculate. the same is true for parameters.
o There is no need to support deprecated parameters, see 9.6.4 ParameterIds Deprecated by Version 2.1 of the Protocol  
o PID_STATUS_INFO contains isUnregisterd, isDisposed info.

OSPL (5.5) Specific Notes
===================
	- TimeBasedFilter is received as two bytes: [0, 0]. It should have been 
	  received as two longs: [0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0] for Duration_t
	- Reliability QoS (kind) seems to have an offset of 1 (starting from 1)
	- Partition for built-in in topics is set to "__BUILT-IN PARTITION__", spec says 
	  default value for Partition is zero length array, and for built-in topics, it is unspecified.
	  And communication should not be established if both entities does not belong to same partition.
	  Should we set the partition for built-in stuff to "*", which would match any partition.
