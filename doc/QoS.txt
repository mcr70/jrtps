QosLiveliness
=============
	o LivelinessManager
		- creates reader and writer for liveliness messages (ParticipantMessage)
		- MANUAL_BY_TOPIC: writer has assertLiveliness() method, that 
		  sends a Heartbeat message to reader

QosReliability
==============
		"8.4.2.3 Required RTPS Reader Behavior
		 A best-effort Reader is completely passive as it only receives data and
		 does not send messages itself."
	o RTPSReader
		- Reader sends AckNack only if reliable.
	o RTPSWriter
		- ReaderProxy keeps track of Readers highest seq num. Used with BEST_EFFORT readers.
		  RELIABLE readers/writers rely solely on heartbeats/acknacks.
		- Liveliness Heartbeat is sent regardless of readers reliability kind.
		- addMatchedReader(...) sends either Heartbeat, or Data message to reader.
