jrtps-0.5.0
	This release is provided as-is. In short, one can get started 
	by using classes in net.sf.jrtps.udds package, which is a minimalistic 
	set of classes that can be used to start communicating over RTPS.

	This release is mainly a refactoring release. Role of the 
	jRTPS vs uDDS is clarified.
