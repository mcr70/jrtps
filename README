jrtps-0.5.6
	This release is provided as-is. In short, one can get started 
	by using classes in net.sf.jrtps.udds package, which is a minimalistic 
	set of classes that can be used to start communicating over RTPS.

	This release contains couple of fixes. Some preliminary work on
	interoperability is also included.
