/**
 * uDDS package provides a simple DDS implementation that utilizes jRTPS. <p>
 * 
 * uDDS aims to be a simplistic version of DDS specification by OMG.
 * Idea is to simplify writing code to DDS domain, while keeping programming interface
 * as simple as possible.<p>
 * 
 * While using jRTPS, uDDS can talk to any vendors DDS implementation, as long as RTPS 
 * is used as a communication protocol. There might(and probably will) be some limitations
 * on what parts of the DDS specification ends up being supported by uDDS.
