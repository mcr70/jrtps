Testing performance of publisher and subscriber.

 - Publisher sends messages as fast it can
 - Subscriber reports after 10 messages, how long it took to 
   receive these messages.
   
Note, that this test is the worst case scenario from the publisher 
point of view, as publisher does not pack multiple messages in 
one Data sub-message.

Initial results are, that 10 messages are delivered to Subscriber
roughly in 1 second.
