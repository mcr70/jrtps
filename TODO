o General
    - We store only one locator for discovery/userdata access. 
      d_mc, d_uc, u_mc, u_uc.
      Instead, we should store a List of locators for each. (tcp, ssl, ...).
      Configuration allows to specify multiple locators, but last one is 
      actually propagated to remote participant.
    - Parameter getBytes() return bytes[] array stored in instance member. 
      subclasses might not update byte[]. Rethink this. For example, see
      how KeyHash handles this.
    
o Quality of Service
    - Use reasonable defaults, configuration, adaptation.

o OSGi
    - OSGi service: DataListener{topic-name, type-name[, qos]}. 
    - What other services is needed?
    - test with felix, equinox, 
	
o Security
    - bouncy castle

o Misc
    - JMS; implement JMS/RTPS
    - Transceiver; Joins DataReader + DataWriter
