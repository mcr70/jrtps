Tests in this directory use JUnit as a launching framework.
But rather than simple unit tests they are actually integration 
tests.

Due to asynchronous nature of RTPS/DDS, these tests might 
sometimes fail, sometimes succeed. In case of failures,
try to adjust configuration parameters in mem-test-1.properties
and mem-test-2.properties:
    - rtps.writer.heartbeat-period
    - rtps.writer.nack-response-delay
    - rtps.reader.heartbeat-response-delay
    - rtps.spdp.resend-data-period
    - udds.sedp-delay

Failures with warnings like 'Rejecting data/heartbeat/... from unknown writer' 
is a good candidate for some adjustment.
